    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>2 lb pumpkin any type</li>
                <li>1 onion, sliced</li>
                <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
                <li>3 cups chicken broth</li>
                <li>1 cup water</li>
                <li>salt and pepper</li>
            </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Cut the pumpkin in 2" slices. Cut off the skin and scrape seeds out.</li>
                <li>Place the pumpkin, onion, garlic, broth, and water in a pot - liquid won't
                    quite cover all the pumpkin. Bring to a boil, uncovered, then reduce heat 
                    and let simmer until pumpkin is tender - about 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove from heat and use a blender to blend until smooth.</li>
                <li>Season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Ladle soup into bowls, sprinkle with pepper and parsley. 
                    Serve with crusty bread!</li>
            </ol>
